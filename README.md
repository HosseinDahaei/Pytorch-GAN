# Pytorch-GAN

Implementations of GAN by pytorch and comparing different versions
Of course, there are lots of official implementations but I found these simple codes good for learning and playing ðŸ™‚

01 . Simple GAN using just a fully connected layer

we are just trying to generate the digit "4" for simplification
but just fully connected layers output wasn't that good!
